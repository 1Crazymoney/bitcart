# Contributing to BitcartCC

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to BitcartCC!

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Asking Questions

Have a question? Rather than opening an issue, please ask away in our [communities](https://bitcartcc.com#community)

The active community will be eager to assist you. Your well-worded question will serve as a resource to others searching for help.

## Providing Feedback

Your comments and feedback are welcome, and the development team is available via a handful of different channels.

Join our [communities](https://bitcartcc.com#community) to share your thoughts.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in BitcartCC? Have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Identify Where to Report

The BitcartCC project is distributed across multiple repositories. Try to file the issue against the correct repository. Check the list of [Linked repositories](https://github.com/MrNaif2018/bitcart/blob/master/README.md#linked-repositories) if you aren't sure which repo is correct.

If the issue is related to BitcartCC deployment and not to some individual components, or you are not sure, you can open an issue on our [central repository](https://github.com/MrNaif2018/bitcart)

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/MrNaif2018/bitcart/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

Be sure to scan through the [most popular](https://github.com/MrNaif2018/bitcart/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) feature requests.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* üëç - upvote
* üëé - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

* Version of BitcartCC

* Your operating system  

* Deployment method: Docker, manual or others

* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue

* What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw

* Images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring


### Final Checklist

Please remember to do the following:

* [ ] Search the issue repository to ensure your report is a new issue

* [ ] Try to isolate the problem

* [ ] Try to gather as much information as possible to reproduce your issue

* [ ] Open an issue and communicate with developers to solve it

Don't feel bad if the developers can't reproduce the issue right away. They will simply ask for more information!
